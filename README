This is the README for cidr, a program that I rewrote and adapted from
a fork of Robert L. Lineberger's cidr program for learning purposes 
and for use in my work as a Systems/Network Engineer. I wrote it to have
a (subjectively) niceish internal design that treats our entered network
as a structure with getter and setter wrapper functions providing an interface
to the datatype.

The program takes an IP and netmask and outputs the network address,
broadcast address, and total number of addresses for the corresponding
subnet.  

To compile and then install run the following command in the cidr/ directory:
# make & make install

From the man page:

CIDR(1)                                                                CIDR(1)

NAME
       cidr - RFC 1878 subnet helper

SYNOPSIS
       cidr [-v]

       cidr <ipaddress> <subnetmask>

       cidr <ipaddress/prefix>

DESCRIPTION
       cidr  is  a  utility for determining the network address and broadcast address for a CIDR subnet.  It takes as input an ip address and netmask or and ip/prefix combination.  It outputs the network address,
       broadcast address, wildcard address and a network size count.

OPTIONS
       -v     print version information

       <ipaddress> <subnetmask>
              IP address will full subnet mask expansion ie. 203.0.113.0 255.255.255.0

       <ipaddress/prefix>
              IP address as an ip/cidr combination ie. 203.0.113.0/24

EXAMPLES
       cidr 198.51.100.0/28

       cidr 198.51.100.0 255.255.255.240
